This is basically for my own reference (because I always forget the steps), but here are instructions
for packaging and publishing Python software on [PyPI][pypi] (Python Package Index). These instructions were
created using Linux, but should generally be the same for any operating system.

[Python Package Index][pypi] (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language.
It contains over 600k Python packages. PyPI allows package authors to distribute their software by
[publishing packages][packaging]. Python users can then easily download or [install][installing] them
with common Python tools.

This guide assumes you have a project hosted in a public repository on [GitHub][github] that you would
like to publish. Your project must contain a packaging configuration file
([`pyproject.toml`][pyproject] or the older `setup.py`).


These are the steps I follow to tag, build, and release:

- Update the version number in your packaging configuration file
- Tag a new release and push it to GitHub:
```
git tag <version number>
git tag # to view tags
git push origin --tags
git fetch
```
(setting a tag with a version number lets users know which commit corresponds with the release)
- Create a new virtual environment and install the dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade build pip twine
```
- Build the package:
```
python -m build
```
(this will build a Source Distribution (sdist) and Binary Distribution (wheel) in the `dist` directory)
- Generate an [API token][api-token] on PyPI (create an account first if needed)
- Upload the new package to PyPI:
```
python -m twine check dist/*
python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```
(enter the API token when prompted)

Done!

Your package should now be available on PyPI.

Note: You can automate this process to make publishing easier. There are Workflows available
on GitHub Actions or your CI tool of choice that will accomplish roughly the same thing.
