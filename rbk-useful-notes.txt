# About node.js and npm
npm stands for "node.js package manager." Straight from the npm website:

npm is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software registry. Discover packages of reusable code — and assemble them in powerful new ways.

To understand npm, you first need to know what Node.js is. Wikipedia says:

[Node.js] executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser.

Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

So to clarify, normally, when you add JavaScript to a webpage, you're writing code that will be rendered on the client's computer. This is fine, but if you're running a lot of code and the user's computer (or smartphone, or whatever they're visiting the page on) is slow, then it will take a lot of time and the user will have a bad experience.

With Node.js you can have your JavaScript code sitting on a server somewhere that runs whenever you decide it to (i.e. from a user requesting it, or whatever other reason you might want it to run.) This is really powerful. You can have that code do anything you want and surprisingly enough, a lot of developers want their code to do similar things. So why would a developer rewrite code that someone else has already written? This is where npm comes into play.

npm is a package manager. What that means is you can use it to download code written by other people to make your life easier. For example, one of the first packages I learned was express which is a simple web framework that allows you to do basic web routing (among other things). So you can have a user type in one address and get one webpage, or type in another address and see a different webpage - all from the same server.
